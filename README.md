# Rainfall-Prediction
RAINFALL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON

1. Introduction
   
Rainfall prediction is a crucial aspect of meteorology, aiding in disaster management, agriculture, and water resource planning. This project aims to analyze weather data and predict rainfall patterns using various meteorological parameters such as temperature, dewpoint, humidity, cloud cover, pressure, and wind characteristics.

2. Objectives
   
-To analyze the relationship between different weather parameters.

-To identify key factors affecting rainfall.

-To build a predictive model for rainfall based on weather variables.

-To assess multicollinearity among variables and determine feature importance.


3. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of historical weather observations, including:

Temperature (Max, Min, Average)

Dewpoint

Humidity

Cloud Cover

Pressure

Sunshine Duration

Wind Speed & Direction

Rainfall Amount (Target Variable)

 Here the target variable is categorical so it is a classification problem.
