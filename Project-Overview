PROJECT PROCESS-

1.Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2.Conducted initial exploration:

 -Checked for null values and duplicate values

 -Examined data types and statistical summaries (df.info(), df.describe()).

3.EDA

 -Plotted histograms and KDE plots to examine the distribution of each feature.
Identifying skewness and outliers in the data.

 -Used boxplots to identify outliers.

4.Data Preprocessing

 -Checked for null or NaN values and handled missing values using median imputation.

 -Checked for data imbalance and used oversampling for balancing the data.

 -Feature Encoding
  Converted categorical feature "Rainfall" using Label Encoding 
 
 - Plotted correlation heatmaps to understand relationships and checked for multicollinearity.

 - Feature Engineering
   calculated temperature difference (max-min) as an additional feature to remove multicollinearity.

 -standardized numeric features using standard scaling

5.Model fitting

 -Divided data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

 -Tested different models like logistic regression,random forest,SVC,XGBoost etc. and after comparing all models

  SVC was selected as the best performing model 
 
 -Confusion matrix and classification report is done.
